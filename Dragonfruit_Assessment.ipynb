    "For microscope images, since each pixel is either black (part of the parasite) or white (background), we can efficiently represent the image using a boolean array or a bitset. Given the large size of the images, a bitset would be more memory-efficient. In a bitset, each pixel can be represented by a single bit (0 for white, 1 for black). The total storage size for a 100,000x100,000 image would be approximately 12.5 MB (100,000 x 100,000 / 8 / 1024 / 1024).\n",
